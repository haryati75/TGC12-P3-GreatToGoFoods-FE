## Target Customers:Â  
A meal-delivery site targeting health-conscious foodies in Singapore to buy ready-to-eat meals, snacks and beverages. 

## Strategy:
Although stocks can be low, Customers are still allowed to make orders and payments while the Business owner fulfils its orders backend.  This is usually suitable for small home-based businesses that has smaller range of products and can make faster turnarounds due to low volume of orders.

## Objectives:
The website allows Customers to perform the following functions:
1. View Products from listing 
2. View a specific Product with Ingredients, Brands, etc
2. Register as a Customer to shop
3. Login/logout as a Customer
3. Reset and Change Password
4. Add to Cart and Shopping Cart changes (quantity, delivery address)
    * Allow to Add to Cart even when Low Stock
5. Checkout and Pay (via Stripe)
    * If Stripe Payment is cancelled (by on GoBack at Stripe), the Cart Items is still available to repeat Checkout 
6. Check Order statuses and view Previous Orders
7. View and Update Customer account, profile 
8. Email to GreatToGo Admin via the Contact Us

## Business Potential
As the business grow, the products can be package as meal plans for recurring delivery scheduled. Loyalty programs can be introduced to provide discounts to Members. Tailoring of diets such as for moms on confinement can be a potential opportunities for growing the customer segments. 

An initial Logical Schema was earlier designed for such growth:
